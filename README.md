 ## Objective - 1----
## *This folder is for my Objective 2 of the assignment.
It includes my own header file and source file where I’ve written the function logic, and a main file to test them both.

## Files Included----
1....  arraylib.h — header file where I’ve declared the functions

2....  arraylib.c — source file where I’ve written the actual function logic

3....  main.c — used to test the functions from mylib

4....  README.md — this file you’re reading

## How to Compile and Run----
## * If you want to compile and run this code, open terminal inside this folder and type:

gcc main.c arraylib.c -o main.exe
main.exe
## What It Does----
* When you run the program, it’ll call the functions from arraylib.c (through array.h) and show their results.
